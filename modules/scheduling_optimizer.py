                Act as a scheduling assistant for an AC repair company. Based ONLY on the provided information, create a *suggested* daily schedule for the available technicians for {schedule_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}.

                **Goal:** Assign jobs to technicians trying to logically group nearby jobs (if location info is provided) and respect priorities and time estimates. Acknowledge that this is a basic suggestion without real-time optimization.

                **Input Information:**
                *   **Technicians Available:**
                {techs_available}
                *   **Jobs to Schedule:**
                {job_list}
                *   **Additional Constraints/Notes:**
                {additional_constraints if additional_constraints else 'None'}

                **Task:**
                1.  Analyze the inputs.
                2.  Assign each job to a technician.
                3.  Provide a potential sequence of jobs for each technician, considering estimated durations and any location hints or constraints mentioned.
                4.  Format the output clearly, showing the schedule per technician.
                5.  Explicitly state if some jobs could not be scheduled or if constraints conflict.
                6.  Include a reminder that this is a *suggestion* and travel time is not precisely calculated.

                **Example Output Format:**

                **Suggested Schedule for {schedule_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}**

                **Tech A (John S.) - 8 AM - 5 PM (Starts: Office)**
                *   8:30 AM - 9:30 AM: Job X (Location/Details) - Est. 1 hr (+ travel)
                *   10:00 AM - 11:30 AM: Job Y (Location/Details) - Est. 1.5 hrs (+ travel)
                *   ... (Lunch Break?) ...
                *   1:00 PM - 3:00 PM: Job Z (Location/Details) - Est. 2 hrs (+ travel)

                **Tech B (Maria G.) - 9 AM - 6 PM (Starts: North Zone)**
                *   9:15 AM - 10:45 AM: Job P (Location/Details) - Est. 1.5 hrs (+ travel)
                *   ... etc ...

                **Notes/Unscheduled:**
                *   [Mention any jobs that couldn't fit or conflicts found]
                *   Reminder: This schedule is a suggestion. Actual travel times and job durations may vary. Dispatcher should confirm.
