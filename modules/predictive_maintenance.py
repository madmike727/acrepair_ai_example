                Act as an experienced HVAC technician providing preventative maintenance advice based *only* on the provided information and general knowledge of common AC component lifespans and failure modes.

                **Do NOT predict specific failures or dates.** Focus on recommending *inspections* or *potential preventative actions* based on age, known issues, and usage.

                **Unit Information:**
                - Model: {ac_model if ac_model else 'Not Specified'}
                - Age: {ac_age} years old
                - Last Known Service: {last_service_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d') if last_service_date else 'Unknown'} ({f'{years_since_service:.1f} years ago' if years_since_service is not None else 'Unknown'})
                - Known Issues/Observations: {known_issues if known_issues else 'None reported'}
                - Usage Pattern: {usage_pattern}

                **Task:** Based *only* on the above, provide a bulleted list of potential preventative maintenance checks or suggestions suitable for this unit. Prioritize suggestions based on likelihood for a unit of this age and profile. Explain *why* each check is relevant (e.g., "Capacitors often degrade after X years..."). Keep suggestions actionable for a technician visit.

                **Example Format:**
                *   **Check Capacitor:** Capacitors are common failure points, especially in units over 5-7 years old. Recommend testing capacitance values.
                *   **Inspect Contactor:** Check for pitting or burning on the contact points, common with age and usage.
                *   **Clean Coils:** Dirty coils reduce efficiency and strain the system, especially important given the age/usage. Recommend checking both evaporator and condenser coils.
                *   **Monitor Refrigerant Charge:** While leaks aren't assumed, verifying charge is good practice during maintenance, especially if past issues were noted.
                *   [Add other relevant points based on input]

                **Output:**
                Provide only the bulleted list of suggestions and their brief justifications.
